# 0x17. Web stack debugging #3
This project was based on fixing a bug in a wordpress web application. The server
returned a 500 error when the GET HTTP method is used. I observed there was a typo
in one of the html directory files (wp-settings.php). Then I wrote a puppet file to
automate fixing such error.
